# Project: Stack Overflow Clone with Integrated Chatbot
As a computer science student, I undertook a project to develop a full-stack web application that emulated the functionality of Stack Overflow, a popular online forum for programming-related questions and answers. I built the application on my own, using MERN Stack, and it featured user authentication, a voting system for answers, and keyword-based question search.

Additionally, I integrated a chatbot into the application using Kommunicate and Diagflow. I trained the chatbot with diagflow to understand queries and provide relevant responses.

Throughout the project, I used Git and GitHub for version control to keep track of changes to the codebase. I also prioritized clean and maintainable code to ensure that the application was both efficient and user-friendly.

Overall, this project allowed me to apply my skills in full-stack web development, gain experience with machine learning and natural language processing, and challenged me to work independently to deliver a high-quality product.
